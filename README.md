# supabase-host

Holds deployment configuration and scripts to self-host Supabase 

The `install/initialise_server.sh` script will install the required dependencies and boot up the docker services, so an installation should look like:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cepro/supabase-host.git && ./supabase-host/install/initialise_server.sh
```
